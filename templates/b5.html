                <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">Mental health is more than just the absence of mental illness. It includes how you feel about yourself and how you adjust to life events.

                    Your mental health influences how you think, feel and behave in daily life.
                    
                    It also affects your ability to cope with stress, overcome challenges, build relationships, and recover from life’s setbacks and hardships.
                    
                    Being mentally or emotionally healthy is much more than being free of depression, anxiety, or other psychological issues. Rather than the absence of mental illness, mental health refers to the presence of positive characteristics.
                    
                    Here’s what truly mentally healthy people do — regardless of where they come from, or what they look like:</p>
                        <p>1. They feel good about themselves.
                            Because they accept who they are and not live their lives based on what people think or feel about them. They understand that self-compassion is so important for life and growth. What other people think doesn’t concern them.</p>
                        <p>2. They do not become overwhelmed by emotions, such as fear, anger, love, jealousy, guilt or anxiety.
                            Mentally healthy people understand that you can’t control how you feel, but you can control how you react to your feelings by focusing on your thoughts. They know wanting to control your feelings at all times is a lost battle no matter how hard you try.
                            
                            However, you should be careful about what to do and say when you are feeling certain emotions. This is your responsibility.</p>
                        <p>3. They have lasting and satisfying personal relationships.
                            No matter how much time you devote to improving your mental and emotional health, you still need the company of others to feel and function at you best. Mentally healthy people know that humans are social creatures with emotional needs for relationships and positive connections to others.
                            
                            They understand that we all need positive connections and interaction with others.
                            
                            We’re not meant to survive, let along thrive, in isolation. Our social brains crave companionship — even when experience has made us shy and distrust of others.</p>
